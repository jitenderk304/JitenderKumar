# Jitender Kumar | Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio website! I am Jitender Kumar, and I hold a PhD in Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience. This website showcases my research, publications, and projects.

## About Me
I specialize in the intersection of biological systems and physics, with a particular focus on how the brain processes sensory information and generalizes knowledge across contexts. My work involves computational neuroscience, nonlinear dynamics, and AI applications inspired by biological learning mechanisms.

## Projects
- **Project 1: Nonlinear Membrane Capacitance**  
  Investigating the effects of nonlinear membrane capacitance in the Hodgkin-Huxley model of action potential on spike train patterns of a single neuron.

- **Project 2: Axonal Ion Channel Cooperativity**  
  Studying the role of axonal ion channel cooperativity in action potential dynamics based on Hodgkin-Huxley’s model.

## Publications
- **Effects of nonlinear membrane capacitance in the Hodgkin-Huxley model of action potential on the spike train patterns of a single neuron.**
- **Investigating the role of axonal ion channel cooperativity in action potential dynamics: Studies on Hodgkin Huxley’s model.**
