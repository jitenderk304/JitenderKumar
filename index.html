    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience, where I specialize in leveraging computational biology and mathematical modeling to unravel the complexities of neural systems. With a strong foundation in biophysics and neural networks, I aim to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical applications in neuroscience.

I hold a Master of Science in Physics from Delhi University, which provided me with a robust understanding of the physical principles underlying biological systems. My expertise in Python programming allows me to develop sophisticated models and simulations that contribute to advancing our knowledge in this interdisciplinary field.

Passionate about research, I am committed to exploring innovative approaches to understand brain function and contribute to the broader scientific community. My goal is to collaborate with like-minded professionals and institutions to drive forward the frontiers of neuroscience..</p>
